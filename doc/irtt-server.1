\f[C]foo\f[] [\f[C]\-bar\f[]] [\f[C]\-c\f[] \f[I]config\-file\f[]]
\f[I]file\f[] \&...
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]foo\f[] frobnicates the bar library by tweaking internal symbol
tables.
By default it parses all baz segments and rearranges them in reverse
order by time for the xyzzy(1) linker to find them.
The symdef entry is then compressed using the WBG (Whiz\-Bang\-Gizmo)
algorithm.
All files are processed in the order specified.
