irtt - Isochronous Round-Trip Time

DESCRIPTION
-----------

`foo` frobnicates the bar library by tweaking internal symbol tables. By
default it parses all baz segments and rearranges them in reverse order by
time for the xyzzy(1) linker to find them. The symdef entry is then compressed
using the WBG (Whiz-Bang-Gizmo) algorithm. All files are processed in the
order specified.

BUGS

The command name should have been chosen more carefully to reflect its
purpose.
